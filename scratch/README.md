# Scratch – Conceptual Computing & Algorithmic Thinking

This section uses Scratch as a **thinking tool**, not a toy.

The projects here are designed to develop:
- Computational thinking
- Mathematical reasoning
- Algorithmic logic
- Early AI-style decision making

Each project follows a **concept-first approach**, where ideas are introduced visually before being translated into text-based coding and robotics platforms.

## Pedagogical Focus

Scratch is used to teach:
- Motion and coordinates before robotics movement
- Logic and conditionals before sensors
- Algorithms before automation
- Ethics and rules before AI tools

These projects are suitable for **upper primary to middle school**, and are easily extendable to Arduino, micro:bit, or Python.

## Project List

| No. | Project Title | Core Concept |
|----|--------------|--------------|
| 01 | Motion & Coordinate System Simulator | X–Y plane, velocity, direction |
| 02 | Fractions & Ratios Visualiser | Math + visual abstraction |
| 03 | Traffic Signal Logic Controller | Sequencing, conditionals |
| 04 | Maze-Solving Virtual Robot | Algorithms, loops, decisions |
| 05 | Rule-Based AI Decision Game | If–then logic, ethics |

## Folder Structure (Standard)

Each project folder contains:

- `description.md` → What the project does and why it matters  
- `learning-objectives.md` → Skills and concepts addressed  
- `scratch-file.sb3` → Main Scratch program  
- `classroom-extension.md` → Ideas for discussion, math linkage, or robotics transfer

---

## Classroom Use

These projects are designed to:
- Support NEP-aligned competency-based learning
- Replace rote coding with reasoning
- Prepare students for physical robotics and real programming

Scratch here is not the end goal — it is the **thinking foundation**.

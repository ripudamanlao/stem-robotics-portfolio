## Motion & Coordinate System Simulator

This project introduces learners to motion using the Cartesian coordinate system (X–Y plane).

A sprite moves on the screen based on changes in its X and Y values, helping students visualise:
- Position
- Direction
- Speed
- Displacement

Instead of memorising formulas, students *see* how numerical changes affect movement.  
This builds a strong conceptual foundation for physics, robotics, and programming.
